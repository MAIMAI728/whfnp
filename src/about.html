				<p>Women Hack for Non-Profits (WHFNP) is a volunteer run community that helps to enhance the skill set of women in technology, support their growth and increase their footprint in the open source community. We match skilled women in technology to open source projects for non-profits, charities and individuals with a good social cause. We are over 340 coders, designers, writers, project managers and testers working on projects that are personally rewarding and contribute to the society at large.</p>

				<p>Established in 2015 Women Hack For Non-Profits (WHFNP) is a fast growing community of women that are looking to improve their coding, testing or design skills. What started out as a simple idea back in May 2015 by co-founders Nandhini Narasimhan and Vinita Rathi has been brought to life and grown to the wonderful community we have today. Our work has gained recognition among the non-profit sector and we have partnered with organisations such as Women Who Code, Code First Girls, AcornHack:Girls, and Empowerhack among many other similar organisations.</p>

					<p>The projects that we choose to work on are always for a good cause. Volunteers can put projects ideas forward to be worked on, but the majority of our projects are work that helps charities and non-profits. These range from simple websites, mobile apps, improving search rankings or a custom content management system that can help charities reach out to a wider audience and promote their cause. Charities pitch these projects to volunteers during the monthly events, after which volunteers self organise into teams and start to work on them. We usually collaborate on Slack, Google Hangouts and during project meet ups in cafes around London.</p>
					<p> Everything is volunteer-led and none of this would be possible without the commitment, determination and time given by the them. Organised by the volunteer board members of the group, we also have monthly workshops, talks, panels and project hack evenings. We have just begun work on two more projects, which brings us up to 10 ongoing projects to this day.</p>
