                <p>WHFNP volunteers built a new page on Findacure's Wordpress website to display members of the organization's new membership scheme. The page was formatted to include each member's bio, logo, and link back to their website. Volunteers also

                <h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS</h3>
                <p>Susan Graham was inspired to create Jaspal's Voice after her sister contracted Motor Neurone Disease and subsequently lost her voice to the disease. Jaspal's Voice aims to collate and review communication devices for those suffering from MND, by providing a catalogue of devices with user-generated reviews and tips.</p>
                <p>Volunteers built the first version of the Jaspal's Voice website in a few short weeks, using Java, the Play framework, and Amazon Web Services. The team​ has also been hard at work on an Android app (soon to be launched) that will provide an easy means of communication and education for people afflicted with or interested in learning more about the disease.

                <p>We are currently working on powering it by a custom CMS and as a future phase, integrate it with an API that provides data surrounding our volunteers and non-profits.
